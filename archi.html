      <h2>Questions to ask SAAS providers around authentication:</h2> 
      <li>How are accounts and passwords created and issued (self registration /manually via an administrative login account) </li>
      <li>Are administrative accounts forced to use 2FA?</li>
      <li>How does 2FA work (SMS Text/Google Authenticator)?</li>
      <li>How many different roles are there?</li>
      <li>Does the system log off the session after a period of inactivity?</li>
      <li>Does the system lockout accounts after a number of unsuccessful attempts?</li>
       
    
      <li>What is the self service password reset process in the event the user forgets their password (eg security questions and answers)?</li>
      <li>If security questions and answers are used, are the questions generated by the user?</li>
      <li>How many questions are there?</li>
      <li>Is there a lockout mechanism to prevent brute forcing of security answers(how many guesses before its locked out)?</li>
      <li>How is the password issued (emailed to the user in plain text, rendered in the application or is a reset link emailed to the user)?</li>
      <li>What is the password complexity policy? What is the minimum length? What characters are permitted and forbidden? Is the user required to use lowercase, uppercase, digits and special symbols?</li>
      <li>Does the system provide functionality to prevent the reuse of an old password or password that closely resembles an old password?</li>
      
      <li>Where are user login credentials stored? Are passwords at rest salted with a value unique to that specific login and then stored using a cryptographicly strong and slow hash that cannot be reversed (not using deprecated hashing techniques such as MD5 and SHA1) ?</li>
      <li>If SSO is available is it implemented in a fundamentally secure and robust way using standard Microsoft ADFS or SAML2.0 rather than
       a proprietary system.</li>
      <li>Does the system have the ability to capture and stop robotic submissions during access logins?</li>
      <li>Is there a public API and how does the authentication work?</li>
          
      <h2>Questions to ask SAAS providers around session management:</h2>
      <li>How does session management work? Are passwords stored in cookies? What is its stored in the cookie? Is the cookie encrypted? What hashing mechanism is used?</li>
       
      <h2>Questions to ask SAAS providers around the security of the web application:</h2> 
      <li>Is HSTS enabled?</li>
      <li>Is the application protected by a WAF?</li>
      <li>What version of TLS and ciphers are enabled?</li>
      
      <h2>Questions to ask SAAS providers around multitenancy:</h2> 
      <li>How does the SAAS multi-tenanted application sufficiently isolate customers data from other tenants?</li>
      <li>How does the SAAS multi-tenanted application sufficiently isolate customer documents/files from other tenants?</li>
      <li>Does the multi-tenanted SAAS application (code) employ appropriate and robust strategies and controls to enforce isolation
        of tenants from one another (eg to limit the scope of the applications backend database queries to the tenants own data)</li>
      <li>How does the SAAS multi-tenanted application restrict any one tenant from monopolizing server servers (which as well as 
        affecting performance for other tenants could be used to exploit vulnerabilties)</li>
      <li>Is data stored at rest in a multi-tenanted SAAS deployment encrypted using unique encryption keys per tenant?</li>
      <li>Are database backups in a multi-tenanted SAAS deployment encrypted using unique encryption keys per tenant?</li>
      <li>What controls are in place to prevent data being restored to the wrong tenant?</li>
    
    <h2>Questions to ask around ETL process:</h2>
    <li>Is sensitive data transferred over a public (Internet) or private (leased line) link?</li>
    <li>Is sensitive data stored on an SFTP server?</li>
    <li>Are data exports encrypted at source before being transferred onto the SFTP server?</li>
    <li>Are data export files secured with access controls at every stage of the ETL process to prevent viewing or 'siphoning off' of the data?</li>
    <li>At each stage of the ETL process data should be deleted and the processing time at each stage should be minimised so that data doesn't
     persist at each stage any longer than necessary. How is this ensured?</li>
    <li>What strategies and controls are used by the ETL application processing logic to enforce isolation of our data from other customers data?</li>

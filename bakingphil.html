	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Combine (preferably in a food processor) 205g of icing sugar and 90g of ground almonds. Sieve the mixture.<br />
Add 72g egg whites, add a few drops of food colouring and mix into a paste.<br />
Cover the bowl with cling film and put to one side.<br />
To make an Italian Meringue put 190g caster sugar and 60ml of water in a pan and heat (eventually to not more than 118C). While that is heating up add 72g egg whites to a bowl and whisk at high speed till you have soft peaks. Once the sugar syrup has reached 118C add the mixture down the side of the bowl while continuing to whisk. Leave it to whisk until it has reached room temperature (approx 5-6mins). It should be glossy and flop over.<br />
Add the meringue to the almond/sugar paste and gradually fold it in (scrape around the bowl and cut through the middle). It is ready when you pick up the spatula and it ribbons back onto the surface.<br />
Now pipe the mixture using a 1cm diameter pipe head onto a tray lined with baking paper. Leave about 1&#8243; between each round. Add sprinkles if desired. Tap the tray a few times to remove any bubbles. Wait for a skin to form before baking. This should take about 5-15 mins in cold weather (30-50 mins otherwise)<br />
Then bake at 165C (gas mark 3/quarter to) for about 12 minutes. Slide the baking paper off the tray and allow to cool for 15 minutes.<br />
Then fill them with eg chocolate ganache.<br />
To make a whipped chocolate ganache:<br />
Bring 100ml of double cream to the boil. Remove from the heat and add 225g plain (unsweetened) chocolate, broken into squares. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Leave until cool but not set and then whip until pale, thick and light. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Makes 16 cakes</strong><br />
113g self-raising flour<br />
113g butter<br />
113g sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
0.5 teaspoon vanilla essence<br />
1 tablespoon milk<br />
Icing<br />
6oz icing sugar<br />
0.25 teaspoon lemon flavouring<br />
2-3 tablespoons warm water &amp; a few drops of yellow food colouring</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 190C.<br />
Sift the flour into a small mixing bowl and set aside.<br />
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon until it is soft. Add the sugar and beat well until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating constantly. If the mixture curdles, add 1 tablespoon of the flour. Using a metal spoon, fold in the remaining flour and vanilla essence. Mix in a little milk, if necessary, to give the batter a dropping consistency.<br />
On a baking sheet, arrange 16 paper cases. Fill the cases two-thirds full with the cake batter. Place the sheet in the oven and bake the cakes for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are golden. Remove the cakes from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.<br />
To make the icing, sift the icing sugar into a small mixing bowl. Stir in the lemon flavouring. Add the water, drop by drop, stirring with a wooden spoon until the icing coats the back of the spoon and a smooth glossy mixture is obtained. Stir in the food colouring.<br />
For chocolate icing sift 1 tablespoon of cocoa with the icing sugar. Flavour with 0.25 teaspoon vanilla essence.<br />
To ice the cakes, drop enough icing on to each cake to cover the top. Decorate the cakes and set them aside until the icing sets.</p>

            some curry leaves<br>
            1/2 tsp asafoetida powder<br>
             Method</p>
<p>            Soak the dal for a minimum of 1/2 an hour and then cook 
with 1/2 tsp turmeric preferably in a pressure cooker. Keep aside.<br>
            In a separate pan with lid, heat the oil. Add the finely 
chopped onions and cook till brown. Add the chopped vegetables and the 
sambaar powder and stir for another minute or two. Now add the tinned 
tomatoes, tamarind paste, coriander leaves and salt to taste. Bring to 
boil and simmer with lid until vegetables are fully cooked. Add the dal 
to this mixture. If you feel the consistency is too thick you can add 
more water. In another pan, heat the ghee. When hot, add the mustard 
seeds, curry leaves and asafeotide powder. Wait until the mustard seeds 
pop and add into the sambaar.<br>
            This can be eaten with rice, upmaa, dosa, idli or adai. </p>

		<p>             Ingredients</p>
<p>            4 hardboiled eggs<br>
            2 onions<br>
            5-6 cloves garlic<br>
            1 inch ginger<br>
            2 tsp coriander powder<br>
            1 tsp whole cumin seeds<br>
            1 tsp chilli powder<br>
            1 tsp turmeric powder<br>
            1 tsp garam masala<br>
            1 tin tomatoes<br>
            salt<br>
            oil<br>
            coriander leaves<br>
            curry leaves<br>
             Method</p>
<p>            Shell the eggs, halve them and lightly brown in a little oil. Keep aside.<br>
            Finely chop the onions. Heat the oil, sizzle the curry 
leaves and cook the onions, garlic and ginger. When soft and light 
brown, add the cumin, coriander and turmeric. Cook for a few more 
minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt and chilli powder and cook for about 15 
minutes on a low heat. Add a little water if you require more sauce. Now
 add the coriander leaves and garam masala and the eggs. Cook on a low 
heat with a lid for a further 5-7 minutes.<br>
            This is equally good with rice or naan bread.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>            Oily fish including mackerel and herring have high 
levels of the health giving omega 3 – known to benefit the heart, help 
keep cholesterol levels under control and thought to reduce the 
likelihood of some cancers – all good reasons to try and include these 
oily fish in your diet a few times each week.</p>
<p>            Serves 2</p>
<p>            2 small whole mackerel, gutted</p>
<p>            For the Sesame Baste<br>
            ½ red chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped<br>
            2 tsp freshly grated root ginger<br>
            1 tsp honey<br>
            1 tbsp olive oil<br>
            1 tsp sesame oil<br>
            splash of soy sauce<br>
            1 tsp sesame seeds<br>
            salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>            To serve<br>
            1 cucumber, de-seeded and evenly diced<br>
            A handful of bitter salad leaves such as rocket, raddichio or chicory<br>
            A few mint and coriander leaves<br>
            Lime Wedges</p>
<p>            1. Slash the fish 7-8 times on each side, straight to the
 bone. Arrange each fish on a large sheet of aluminium foil.</p>
<p>            2. Mix together the baste ingredients and brush over the 
fish, taking care to push some into the slashes of the fish. Leave to 
marinade for 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>            3. Preheat the grill to its highest setting. Grill the 
fish for 3-4 minutes on each side until cooked through. The flesh will 
look opaque and be firm to the touch.</p>
<p>            4. Make the salad: toss the cucumber together with the 
salad leaves and herbs. Divide between 4 plates and arrange a fish on 
top of each.<br>
            Serve straight away.</p>
<p>            Alternatives: sea bass, gurnard, grey mullet </p>

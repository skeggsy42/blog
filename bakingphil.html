            <p>
                Ingredients<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>455g Farfalle </li>
                    <li>1 egg </li>
                    <li>100ml double cream </li>
                    <li>Sea salt & freshly ground black pepper </li>
                    <li>12 rashers of pancetta, roughly sliced </li>
                    <li>3 handfuls of fresh podded or frozen peas. </li>
                    <li>2 sprigs of fresh mint, leaves picked </li>
                    <li>2 handfuls of freely grated parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the farfalle, and cook according to the packet instructions. </li>
                    <li>Whisk the egg in a bowl with the cream, salt and pepper. </li>
                    <li>Put the pancetta into a second pan and cook until crispy and golden. </li>
                    <li>When the farfalle is nearly cooked, add the peas for the last minute and a half. </li>
                    <li>When cooked, drain in a colander, saving a little of the cooking water. </li>
                    <li>Add the pasta to the pancetta and stir in most of the mint, finely sliced.  </li>
                    <li>Now add the egg and cream mix to the pasta while the pasta is still hot so that the pasta will cook the egg but not so that they resemble scrambled eggs. It should give you a silky smooth sauce. Toss together and loosen with a little of the reserved cooking water if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with the parmesan and the rest of the mint leaves and serve as soon as possible. </li>

                Home made custard is always a winner for pouring over traditional puds. Use a little more cornflour if you like your custard thick.

                <p>
                    Combine (preferably in a food processor) 205g of icing sugar and 90g of ground almonds. Sieve the mixture.<br />
                    Add 72g egg whites, add a few drops of food colouring and mix into a paste.<br />
                    Cover the bowl with cling film and put to one side.<br />
                    To make an Italian Meringue put 190g caster sugar and 60ml of water in a pan and heat (eventually to not more than 118C). While that is heating up add 72g egg whites to a bowl and whisk at high speed till you have soft peaks. Once the sugar syrup has reached 118C add the mixture down the side of the bowl while continuing to whisk. Leave it to whisk until it has reached room temperature (approx 5-6mins). It should be glossy and flop over.<br />
                    Add the meringue to the almond/sugar paste and gradually fold it in (scrape around the bowl and cut through the middle). It is ready when you pick up the spatula and it ribbons back onto the surface.<br />
                    Now pipe the mixture using a 1cm diameter pipe head onto a tray lined with baking paper. Leave about 1&#8243; between each round. Add sprinkles if desired. Tap the tray a few times to remove any bubbles. Wait for a skin to form before baking. This should take about 5-15 mins in cold weather (30-50 mins otherwise)<br />
                    Then bake at 165C (gas mark 3/quarter to) for about 12 minutes. Slide the baking paper off the tray and allow to cool for 15 minutes.<br />
                    Then fill them with eg chocolate ganache.<br />
                    To make a whipped chocolate ganache:<br />
                    Bring 100ml of double cream to the boil. Remove from the heat and add 225g plain (unsweetened) chocolate, broken into squares. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Leave until cool but not set and then whip until pale, thick and light.

                <li>1 small sea bass, trimmed, scaled and filleted</li>
                <p>For the parcel</p>
                <li>2 lime wedges.</li>
                <li>A few sliced spring onions or sliced red onion</li>
                <li>3 shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced or finely sliced fennel</li>
                <li>splash of olive oil</li>
                <li>A herb of your choice: dill, tarragon, rosemary, oregano etc</li>
                <li>A splash of white wine or Pernod</li>
                <li>Optional: a drop or two of truffle oil sprinkled onto the fish, once it is cooked.</li>
                <p>
                    Heat the oven to gas mark 7, 210C. Arrange the fish fillets, sandwiched skin side outside on a large sheet of baking paper.
                    Arrange the ingredients around the fish and season lightly. Add the oil and drizzle with wine or Pernod.
                    Wrap the fish securely, but not too tightly, so that the steam can circulate. Roast in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until cooked. The flesh will be firm and opaque. Open the parcel and squeeze the lime juice over the fish. Serve the fish directly from the baking paper.

                    <li>0.25 teaspoon lemon flavouring</li>
                    <li>2-3 tablespoons warm water &amp; </li>
                    <li>a few drops of yellow food colouring</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 190C.<br />
                Sift the flour into a small mixing bowl and set aside.<br />
                In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon until it is soft. Add the sugar and beat well until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating constantly. If the mixture curdles, add 1 tablespoon of the flour. Using a metal spoon, fold in the remaining flour and vanilla essence. Mix in a little milk, if necessary, to give the batter a dropping consistency.<br />
                On a baking sheet, arrange 16 paper cases. Fill the cases two-thirds full with the cake batter. Place the sheet in the oven and bake the cakes for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are golden. Remove the cakes from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.<br />
                To make the icing, sift the icing sugar into a small mixing bowl. Stir in the lemon flavouring. Add the water, drop by drop, stirring with a wooden spoon until the icing coats the back of the spoon and a smooth glossy mixture is obtained. Stir in the food colouring.<br />
                For chocolate icing sift 1 tablespoon of cocoa with the icing sugar. Flavour with 0.25 teaspoon vanilla essence.<br />
                To ice the cakes, drop enough icing on to each cake to cover the top. Decorate the cakes and set them aside until the icing sets.

                    <p>
                        Soak the dal for a minimum of 1/2 an hour and then cook
                        with 1/2 tsp turmeric preferably in a pressure cooker. Keep aside.<br>
                        In a separate pan with lid, heat the oil. Add the finely

                        to this mixture. If you feel the consistency is too thick you can add
                        more water. In another pan, heat the ghee. When hot, add the mustard
                        seeds, curry leaves and asafeotide powder. Wait until the mustard seeds
                        pop and add into the sambaar.<br>

                    Oily fish including mackerel and herring have high
                    levels of the health giving omega 3 – known to benefit the heart, help
                    keep cholesterol levels under control and thought to reduce the
                    likelihood of some cancers – all good reasons to try and include these
                    oily fish in your diet a few times each week.
                </p>
                <p>            Serves 2</p>
                <ul><li>2 small whole mackerel, gutted</li></ul>
                For the Sesame Baste
                <ul>
                    <li>½ red chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 tsp freshly grated root ginger</li>
                    <li>1 tsp honey</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
                    <li>splash of soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>
                    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <p>         To serve<br></p>
                <li>1 cucumber, de-seeded and evenly diced</li>
                <li>A handful of bitter salad leaves such as rocket, raddichio or chicory</li>
                <li>A few mint and coriander leaves</li>
                <li>Lime Wedges</li></ul>
                <p>
                    1. Slash the fish 7-8 times on each side, straight to the
                    bone. Arrange each fish on a large sheet of aluminium foil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Mix together the baste ingredients and brush over the
                    fish, taking care to push some into the slashes of the fish. Leave to
                    marinade for 5-10 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Preheat the grill to its highest setting. Grill the
                    fish for 3-4 minutes on each side until cooked through. The flesh will
                    look opaque and be firm to the touch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Make the salad: toss the cucumber together with the
                    salad leaves and herbs. Divide between 4 plates and arrange a fish on
                    top of each.<br>
                    Serve straight away.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>600g / 5 ½ cups plain wholemeal / wholemeal all purpose flour</li>
                        <li>150g / 1 ¼ cups plain white / white all purpose flour</li>
                        <li>75g / ½ cup oatmeal</li>
                        <li>2 ½ teaspoons of bread soda</li>
                        <li>2 ½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>

                        <li>480 ml / 2 cups milk</li>
                        <li>200 ml / 3/4 cups black treacle / molasses</li>
                        <li>½ pint draught Guinness (see note above)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Preparation:
                        Preheat the oven to 170 °C/350 °F/gas 4 and lightly grease a loaf tin with butter.
                        Place all the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and rub into the dry ingredients until it resembles fine breadcrumbs - I recommend working quickly as the mixture can easily become greasy if over mixed, or mixed using too warm hands.
                        Add the milk, black treacle / molasses and the Guinness. Mix to create a wet dough.
                        Grease a standard loaf tin, add the wet dough and bake in the oven for 40 - 45 mins or until the bread is well risen and cooked through.
                        Leave for 10 minutes in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Eat while slightly warm if you like, or leave to go completely cold. Delicious with salty butty and Irish smoked salmon, cold meats or cheeses.

                <h1 class="entry-title">Parmesan-baked Parsnips</h1>
                <p>
                    This is one of the nicest ways to serve parsnips, baked crisp and golden brown in the oven with a Parmesan coating. They can be prepared well in advance, up to 24 hours, or they can even be prepared and frozen and will then cook perfectly if allowed to defrost first. This recipe also works very well with sweet potatoes. If you are roasting potatoes on the top shelf, these can cook beneath.

                    Serves 8

                    This recipe is taken from Delia Smith’s Christmas and Delia's Vegetarian Collection.

                    Parmesan-baked Parsnips
                    Ingredients
                    <ul>
			    <li>2 oz (50 g) freshly grated Parmesan (Parmigiano Reggiano); see recipe introduction
                    <li>2½ lb (1.25 kg) parsnips</li>
                    <li>6 oz (175 g) plain flour</li>
                    <li>groundnut or other flavourless oil for baking</li>
                    <li>a knob of butter</li>
                    <li>salt and freshly milled black pepper</li>
		    </ul>
		    </p>
		    <p>Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 6, 400°F (200°C).</p>
                    <p>Equipment
                    You will also need a large, solid roasting tin.
		</p>
		    <p>Method
                    Begin by combining the flour, Parmesan, salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Peel the parsnips using a potato peeler. Then halve and quarter them lengthways and cut each length in half across, so that you end up with smallish chunks. Cut out any tough woody centres.

                    Now pop the parsnips in a saucepan, pour in enough boiling water just to cover them and add salt. Put on a lid, bring them to the boil and boil for 3 minutes.
                    Meanwhile have a large kitchen tray ready. Then, as soon as they are ready, drain them in a colander and, whilst they are still steaming, drop a few at a time (with the aid of some kitchen tongs) into the flour and parmesan mixture, shaking the bowl and moving them around so that they get a good even coating.

                    As they are coated transfer them to the tray. Make sure you do them all fairly swiftly as the flour mixture will only coat them whilst they are still steamy! When they're all coated they are ready to cook or store in the fridge or freeze.

                    Any leftover flour and Parmesan can be kept (sifted) in the fridge or freezer for another time. What is important is to have plenty in order to coat the parsnips quickly.
                    To bake them, place a large solid roasting tin in the oven to pre-heat and in it put enough oil just to cover the base and a knob of butter for flavour. Then, when the oven is ready, remove the tin and place it over direct heat (turned fairly low) and, again using tongs, place the parsnips quickly side by side in the tin.

                    Tilt it and baste all the parsnips with hot fat, place the tin in the oven and bake them for 20 minutes, then turn them over, drain off any surplus fat (a bulb baster is good for this) and continue to bake for a further 15-20 minutes or until they are crisp and golden

            <h1 class="entry-title">Gluten Free Cauliflower Cheese</h1>

            Here is the first of our brand new recipes for 2013, we make this for the entire family as it is completely indistinguishable from 'normal' cauliflower cheese and tastes absolutely wonderful!

            Preparation Time -  30 minutes
            Cooking time - 25 minutes
            Makes / Serves - 4 portions
            Child friendly - 1/5
            Difficulty rating - 3/5

            Ingredients:

            1 large cauliflower
            70 g gluten free plain flour alternative
            50 g butter (or good quaility 'spreadable')
            450 ml milk (any except skimmed)
            150 ml stock (the water the cauliflower is cooked in)
            90 g cheddar cheese (whatever strength you prefer)
            pinch of salt
            pinch of black pepper

            Method:
            Cut the cauliflower into florets as evenly as possible.
            Boil the cauliflower in a large pan until tender (10-15 minutes), drain well and set aside 150 ml of the stock water for later use.
            Pre-heat the oven to 200 C / 400 F / Gas Mark 6.
            Place the florets into a medium sized oven proof dish (we use a lasagne dish) and set aside.
            Now it's time to make the cheese sauce. Over a low heat, melt the butter in a medium sized pan, then remove from the heat and stir in the flour to make a smooth paste.
            Return to the heat and gradually stir in the milk, mixing well after each addition.
            Stir the sauce continuously until the mixture thickens, which can take several minutes.
            Add the stock, salt, and black pepper to the pan and mix well.
            Add around two thirds of the cheese, mix well and remove from the heat.
            Pour the sauce evenly over the cauliflower and then sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.
            Bake in the oven for around 25 minutes or until the cheese starts to brown.
            Tips:
            If the sauce has not thickened enough after 5-6 minutes you might need to add an extra 5 g of flour, it really depends on the flour used, don't be afraid to add more if you feel it's needed.
            Cauliflower cheese is often served as a meal in itself, to make it a more well rounded meal you could grill 6-8 rashers of streaky bacon before starting the recipe, cut them into small pieces and mix into the sauce just before pouring over the cauliflower.

                Ingredients
                • 4.5 litres boiling water
                • 1.8 kg pears
                • 2 tsp pectic enzyme
                • 900 g sugar
                • 2 lemons, juice only
                • 1x7 g sachet dried yeast
                • 3 tsp yeast nutrient
                • 1 campden tablet
                Method
                • 1. You will need a white 9 litre capacity plastic bucket with lid, wooden spoon, 2 x 4.5 litre glass demijohn, rubber bung (with hole), plastic air lock, plastic siphon tubing, sterilising powder, large plastic funnel, 2 x empty 2 litre screw top plastic bottles, 1 x empty 1 litre screw top plastic bottle.
                • 2. Pour the boiling water over the pears, pressing well to extract the juice. Leave for 4-5 hours.
                • 3. Add the pectic enzyme. Cover and leave for 4 days to infuse.
                • 4. Strain the pears through muslin and pour the liquid through a large funnel, into the demijohn.
                • 5. Add the sugar and lemon juice.
                • 6. Add the yeast and yeast nutrient and fit the airlock. Keep in a warm room.
                • 7. After about 7-10 days, when the wine begins to clear and the bubbles have slowed down, siphon the wine off the 'lees' (the debris in the bottom of the demijohn) into a clean demijohn.
                • 8. After about another 3-4 days, when all fermentation has stopped (no more bubbles through the air-lock), siphon off the 'lees' into clean demijohn. Add a Campden tablet - Campden tablets are used to kill naturally occurring wild yeasts and undesirable bacteria.
                • 9. Stopper the jar and leave in a cool place for a further 10 days. The wine should be clear.
                • 10. Siphon the wine into clean empty plastic bottle and store in a cool place. The wine should be ready after about 3 months.

		<li>Meanwhile slowly and carefully slice the chives as finely as you can. </li>
		<li>Once the vegetables are cooked, drain and allow to steam dry in a colander.</li>
                <li>Put the pan back on a low heat and add the 2 knobs of butter, a teaspoon of cider vinegar, a
                good pinch of salt and pepper and your finely chopped chives.</li>

                <li>Score each scallop halfway through in a crisscross pattern. Season each one  on both sides with salt, pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and a few fennel seeds. </li>
		<li>Get a large frying pan on a high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
                <li>Add the bacon to the pan and fry for 5 minutes, or until lightly golden, then move the bacon to a plate and add the slices of black pudding. </li>

                <li>Put the frying pan straight back on the heat and add a lug of fresh olive oil, a small knob of butter and the scallops, scored side down, and turn the heat down to low. Cook for just 2 minutes, then turn them over and give them no more than 1 minute. Add the sage leaves to the pan to crisp up and once ready to serve, squeeze over the juice of half the lemon and shake everything about.</li>

                <li>Divide the scallops and crispy sage leaves between everyone and spoon some of the delicious cooking juices from the pan over each plate. Serve with some steamed greens and a few wedges of lemon for squeezing over, and it’s happy days.</li>

            <h1 class="entry-title">Jamies Real Mushroom Soup</h1>
            <p>


                ' When I first moved to London I worked in the Neal Street Restaurant in Covent Garden. it was famous for its wild mushrooms, and my mate Gennaro used to go out every day during mushroomseason to find them. It was in this restaurant that I tasted a real mushroom soup for the first time.
                Those awful tins of mushroom soup that we’ve all tasted just became a distant memory!

                The nice thing about nearly all mushrooms is that, if cooked correctly, they do have wonderful flavour. If you were to use a field of Portabello mushrooms to make a soup, just adding a tiny bit of dried porcini into the base would make the whole thing more luxurious.

                SERVES 6
	    <ul>
                <li>a small handful of dried porcini.</li>
                <li>a handful of fresh thyme, leaves picked.</li>
		<li>olive oil.</li>
		<li>600g mixed fresh wild mushrooms (chanterelles, girolles, black pepper
                trompettes de mort, shitake or
                oyster). cleaned and sliced.</li>
		<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
		<li>1 litre of chicken or vegetable stock.</li>
		<li>a handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley,leaves picked and roughly chopped.</li>
		<li>2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely sliced.</li>
		<li>1 red onion. peeled and finely chopped.</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons mascarpone cheese.</li>
		<li>1 lemon.</li>
		<li>a knob of butter.</li>
		<li>optional: truffle oil.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		Method:
		<p>
                Place the porcini in a small dish, add boiling water just to cover, and leave to soak. Get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms. Stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion, butter and thyme and a small amount of seasoning. After about a minute you’ll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan. Carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears.

                Season to taste, and add your stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes. I usually remove half the soup from the pan and whizz it up to a puree at this point. then pour it back in adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste.

                You can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off. Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostlni put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice looking mushrooms — like girolles, chanterelles or oysters — and sprinkle these on top of the soup. If I was going to use truffle oil, then I would use it on its own - a few drips on the top just before serving.

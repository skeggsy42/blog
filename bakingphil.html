	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Combine (preferably in a food processor) 205g of icing sugar and 90g of ground almonds. Sieve the mixture.<br />
Add 72g egg whites, add a few drops of food colouring and mix into a paste.<br />
Cover the bowl with cling film and put to one side.<br />
To make an Italian Meringue put 190g caster sugar and 60ml of water in a pan and heat (eventually to not more than 118C). While that is heating up add 72g egg whites to a bowl and whisk at high speed till you have soft peaks. Once the sugar syrup has reached 118C add the mixture down the side of the bowl while continuing to whisk. Leave it to whisk until it has reached room temperature (approx 5-6mins). It should be glossy and flop over.<br />
Add the meringue to the almond/sugar paste and gradually fold it in (scrape around the bowl and cut through the middle). It is ready when you pick up the spatula and it ribbons back onto the surface.<br />
Now pipe the mixture using a 1cm diameter pipe head onto a tray lined with baking paper. Leave about 1&#8243; between each round. Add sprinkles if desired. Tap the tray a few times to remove any bubbles. Wait for a skin to form before baking. This should take about 5-15 mins in cold weather (30-50 mins otherwise)<br />
Then bake at 165C (gas mark 3/quarter to) for about 12 minutes. Slide the baking paper off the tray and allow to cool for 15 minutes.<br />
Then fill them with eg chocolate ganache.<br />
To make a whipped chocolate ganache:<br />
Bring 100ml of double cream to the boil. Remove from the heat and add 225g plain (unsweetened) chocolate, broken into squares. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Leave until cool but not set and then whip until pale, thick and light. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Makes 16 cakes</strong><br />
113g self-raising flour<br />
113g butter<br />
113g sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
0.5 teaspoon vanilla essence<br />
1 tablespoon milk<br />
Icing<br />
6oz icing sugar<br />
0.25 teaspoon lemon flavouring<br />
2-3 tablespoons warm water &amp; a few drops of yellow food colouring</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 190C.<br />
Sift the flour into a small mixing bowl and set aside.<br />
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon until it is soft. Add the sugar and beat well until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating constantly. If the mixture curdles, add 1 tablespoon of the flour. Using a metal spoon, fold in the remaining flour and vanilla essence. Mix in a little milk, if necessary, to give the batter a dropping consistency.<br />
On a baking sheet, arrange 16 paper cases. Fill the cases two-thirds full with the cake batter. Place the sheet in the oven and bake the cakes for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are golden. Remove the cakes from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.<br />
To make the icing, sift the icing sugar into a small mixing bowl. Stir in the lemon flavouring. Add the water, drop by drop, stirring with a wooden spoon until the icing coats the back of the spoon and a smooth glossy mixture is obtained. Stir in the food colouring.<br />
For chocolate icing sift 1 tablespoon of cocoa with the icing sugar. Flavour with 0.25 teaspoon vanilla essence.<br />
To ice the cakes, drop enough icing on to each cake to cover the top. Decorate the cakes and set them aside until the icing sets.</p>

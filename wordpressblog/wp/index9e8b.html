<p>Had a lovely continental breakfast at Villa Vita hotel before setting off for Kuznice. Walked part of way then got a horse and cart. Cable car was very busy, so went for a walk, approx 1 hour up to a good view point and had a hot chocolate in a cabin cafe. Yamini thanked me for forcing her to walk so far since the view was very good. We then walked all the way back down to Zakopane, about an hours walk (in the rain). Stopped to sample the local &#8217;speciality&#8217;, grilled ewe&#8217;s cheese or Oscypki which looks like bread and is on sale everywhere. I didn&#8217;t like it much. Surprisingly breakfast lasted until we ate at 19:00 at Sabata.Yam had lamb in a red wine sauce which was nicer than my duck with apple (which was pretty good). Then had apple pie and cream each and a gluhwein and coffee. This and a couple of beers and cokes was 132zl (approx Â£30).</p>

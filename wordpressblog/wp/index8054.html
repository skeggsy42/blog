<p>Up at 2:45 and left for Gatwick at 3:30. Seems everyone else gave Gatwick a miss today so we had over an hour to wander around duty free.<br />
Flew to Alicante Aeropuerto, Spain 07:30 Thursday (plane half hour late). Hired car using Holidayautos.co.uk. The local operator was Aurego. The airport is well layed out and car hire is easy to find. Car washer bottle was empty which does make me question the general car maintenance standards, Spain is also rather dusty so discovering that the washer bottle is empty on the motorway is a pain. The drive to Javea took a couple of hours (1 hour trying to get out of Alicante), signage in Spain takes a bit of getting used to! Purpose of trip was to install VOIP phone for the company, this all worked first time without any problems which is amazing as I was expecting something to go wrong. The electric in spain is 230v so UK electrical items worked. The modem I took over was a UK purchased BT Voyager 2110 wireless. The ADSL settings are standard for each country so reconfiguring the modem with standard Spanish settings and inputting the telefonica username and password and it connected first time.<br />
Javea is very nice and had a nice spag bol in a restaurant overlooking the sea on the avenida del mediterraneo.<br />
Yamini spent sometime in a beach bar whilst I was working.<br />
Then drove back to Alicante, slightly different more scenic route back via benissia (???).<br />
Drove to airport to drop car off but realised that I had not filled up petrol. Then drove off looking for a petrol station but ended up in the centre of Alicante before we found one. Change of plan, park up, check into hotel (Hesperia Lucentum) which was very central modern businesslike hotel. Freshened up before filling up petrol tank and dropping off the car. Airport bus back from airport to alicante was 1 euro and waited about 2 minutes (lucky as they are every 45 minutes) and it took about 15 minutes.<br />
Did not bother going back to hotel but did some shopping, some beers and food near harbour.</p>

			<h2>Thursday 8th May</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Up at 08:30 for breakfast at Nidos Smilte hotel which was a poor showing esp in comparison with Zakopane Villa Vita. Went for an hours cycling along the Lagoon. Another really nice day. Booked bus ticket for 12:00 to Smiltyne (14Lit) and then had a cappacino (4lit) and banana crepe (8 Lit) at Kursis Kavine in Nida. (The old man renting cycles from his front garden is just opposite and is recommended - no forms to sign etc but bikes probably a bit older than some of street corner renters). Bus 12:00 arrived 13:00 smiltyne. Got 13:15 ferry. Walked to bus station (20 min) and got 15:00 bus to Riga (110 LIT) arriving 19:00. Pretty bumpy ride and some unmade roads, Yamini was sick. First impression gritty ex soviet mafia run town full of nutters, maybe we are in the wrong part of town. Prefer quaint Vilnius. Checked into hotel enkurs approx 20:00, then went out for dinner at Macarooni, a noodle bar. Had fish soup/miso soup and halibut/spag bol (24 LAT).</p>

Up at 6:00am, checkout 06:30 and arrive Warsaw Central Station by 07:45. Train is 07:24 to Sestokai. Hurriedly got some lunch as no restaurant car on this train.Second class is very comfortable. Stops at Balystok at 09:55 until 10:10, train empties out at this stop.<br />
Ticket inspector tried to tell us we need to be in front two carriages but we didn&#8217;t understand. Understood a bit later as we had to run for it.<br />
Landscape is not so flat as we approach Lithuania and quite beautiful.<br />
Changed train at Sestokai (Lithuania) at 14:48. No passport checks on this journey.<br />
Lithuanian time 1 hour ahead of Polish time. Arrive Vilnius 17:50. Train station is very clean (in fact nicer than Warsaw or Krakow). Walked to our b&amp;b and then went out for a walk and some dinner. Went to Indian place, Balti Drambliau, which was v.popular, both had spinach curry which was delicious. It had green beans, peas, tomato and spinach and a spice which I cannot name but recognise. The vegetable samosa which was homemade was excellent. Also incredibly cheap at 42.50 Lit (about Â£10) inc beer and fresh juice. This place is a real find. Then had a baileys coffee for 14lit in Double Coffee, the logo looks like Costa Coffee but had Double Coffee instead. Also bought 10 individual nescafe instant coffees for 5.50 Lt. Vilnius seems quite a sleepy laid back &#8220;city&#8221; with not much to do, I like it here.</p>

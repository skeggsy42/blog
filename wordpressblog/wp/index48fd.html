				<p>Eurostar departs 12:57pm from st.pancreas, arrives at 16:03 in brussels. Had a hot choc for €1.75 and then put bag in left luggage €3.00. Bought metro day pass for €4 and took metro 2 to arts loi and then changed to metro 1a going to heysel. Arrived about 17:30 to see the Atomium. Then took metro 1a to saint catherine for some food. Went to La Melodie on boulevard emile jacqmain. Ordered a duvel for €3 and calzone for €11. Yam had grilled tuna for €13 and orange juice for €2.20. Total €29. Took a metro to central square and saw maniquin piss. Walked through Galeries St Hubert, built in 1847, the grande dame of Brussels shopping arcades includes Neuhaus, a chocolate shop est in 1857. Purchased 4 begian chocolates for €2.47 from Corne Port Royal Chocalatiers. Walked down Rue des Bouchers. Went for a beer in LeRoy D&#8217;Espagne, Grand Place - another Duvel (€5.90) for me and a juice (3.90) for Yamini. At least the nuts are free.

			<h2>Friday 2nd May</h2>

				<p>Left apart 08:15 for Krakow to Auschwitz train at 09:15, should arrive 10:42. Left luggage at Krakow station was 8 zl. At Oswiecim train station hung around outside with lots of other people, none of whom seemed to know where to go. A bus arrived and a local old man said that it is the one we want. Museum was only a few hundred metres up the road. Huge numbers of people made buying tour an ordeal (cost was 39zl each). About 30 people in our group but the guide had a mic and transmiter and we each had headphones and a receiver which was pretty neat. The tour was not surprisingly rather depressing. It started at 11:30 at Auschwitz I and finished at Berkenhau. Much of Berkenhau was destroyed by the Germans but you can see the huge scale of the camp. Got a cab back to Oswiecim train station (18 zl) and got 15:39 train to Krakow (22 zl). This was a short slow train taking 2 hours. Took coach to Zakopane leaving at 18:15. Seats reserved but there was a nun sitting in our seat and I didn&#8217;t want to kick her out. Arrived Zakopane 20:30 and walked to our hotel, Villa Vita on Krupowska street. Room is very nice. Went out for dinner, pork shoulder and roast potatoes (23zl) and then a waffle with cream and chocolate.</p>

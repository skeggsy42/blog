			<h2>Monday 2nd January 2006</h2>

				<p>Had toast &amp; Idly for breakfast.<br />
Picked up by mini coach for our tour at 10am.<br />
First stop was Erivakulam National park at the top of a mountain. We switched to a jeep at the entrance to the park. As a foreign national I paid 200 rupees for entrance but Binnie the driver got Yamini&#8217;s ticket which was 15 rupees. Saw some rare goat that was nearly extinct &amp; is now protected. Saw a rare plant that only flowers once every 12 yrs - Neelakurinji. On the way back down we stopped at a waterfall where we also saw some beautiful blue butterflies. We also stopped to look at the tea plantations. We then stopped for lunch at Bhavan Saravan in centre of Munnar.<br />
After lunch we stopped at two dams.<br />
Stopped at echo point.<br />
Drove to Top Station which was covered in cloud. Bought some green tea.  Yamini wasn&#8217;t cold in her shorts, eventhough we were told it was 7 degrees centigrade.<br />
On way back down saw some wild elephants that had ventured into the tea plantation. Also saw some working elephants. Saw some eucalyptus trees.<br />
Arrived back at Tea County approx 6pm.<br />
Had a beer in the bar &amp; wrote journal and then dinner. Had chicken Khorma which looked a really nice green &amp;  lovely smell which is why I had some. Tasted nice though lightly spiced. Whereas usually chicken korma is such a ghastly artificial colour so never actually had it before.<br />
Had Gulab Jamun for dessert.<br />

				<p>Nice continental breakfast served in room at Liniterp Guest House. Checked out at 08:30am and walked 10 min to old ferry terminal. Next ferry at 10:00am and takes 15 min to get to Smiltyne. Got the 10:15 bus from Smiltyne (14LIT for both of us) arrived 11:15 Nida. Checked into hotel Nidos Smilte which was next to Thomas Manns house and has a great view of the Lagoon. Room is very nice (180 LIT). Hired some bicycles (50LIT for 2 bikes for 24 hours) . Cycled along coastline far enough to recieve the Welcome to Russia text message on my mobile and could see the Kalingrad part of the curonian spit. Saw Chaffinch in pine forest and the shifting sand dunes. Weather was really nice today. Had lunch - Potatoe pancakes with meat and mushroom filling was very nice. More cycling, this time in other direction. Visited supermarket, purchased a couple of beers 2.19lt (50p) each. Chilled out.</p>

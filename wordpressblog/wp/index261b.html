			<h2>Sunday 4th May</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Had continental breakfast in Villa Vita and then checked out and walked to Zakopane train station. Did not stop raining again. Poles have a thing for cheap colourful disposable macs that cost 5zl. Yam bought one on the way. Our second class seats in a cabin for six people were very comfortable. Train departs at 11:36am. Arrived Warsaw later than expected at 18:15. Glad we booked seats as quite a few people standing. Checked into easily located Novotel (due to big neon sign) and then took hotel taxi to Rynek Starego Miasta in old town for dinner at U Fukiera (bill 508 zl). Walked to main road and took tram back to hotel.</p>

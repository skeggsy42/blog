				<p>Appointment with Magnet designer/salesman in Orpington.<br />
Showroom was very slick, lots of plasma screens which is nice- obviously Magnet are doing well. Bit early so browsed around. Almost hit in the head by a piece of wood that flew out of a high cabinet - it did have a sticker on it saying open me so bit sloppy on the health and safety side! Designer/salesman was very pleasant, that is until the end when I said our timescale was 1 year and then he was suddenly very off. That was rather disappointing really. I asked how long they save the quote for and he said they save the quote for one week and that they don&#8217;t work to 1 year timescales! He obviously cussed us to one of the other salesmen who meandered round to give us a quick look. Considering how glossy the showroom looks I expected a bit more professionalism but I guess they don&#8217;t need our money. Anyway the quote was midway at �5300 after discounts which is ok. They used 20-20 Design software (http://www.2020technologies.com/us-eng/20-20Design/index.aspx) which crashed once and of course he hadn&#8217;t saved the design and had to start again.<br />
Started work on the floor, replacing woodwormy joists and laying plywood.<br />
Costs so far:<br />
Joists (3 x 3.6m) �14.59 champion timber<br />
joists (4 x 3.6m) �19.46 champion timber<br />
Plyboard 9 x �9.49 �85.41 wickes<br />
Plywood 3 * 9.99 = 29.97 wickes<br />
screws �2.89</p>

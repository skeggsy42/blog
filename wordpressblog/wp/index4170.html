			<div class="entry">
				<p>Visit to B&amp;Q to look at their kitchens. The white gloss slab looks ok and was very cheap but all the cabinets are poor quality with a naff old fashioned looking flowery pattern inside.<br />
We did like the quartz onyx black worktop though, the example price given for a small kitchen was �800 although I guess that doesn&#8217;t include installation.<br />
Dropped into MFI which had same worktop called Diamond Black Quartz. They had other colours including red. They quoted �300-�500 per metre dependent on exactly what you want done. This would cost �1560-�2600 based on our measurements.</p>

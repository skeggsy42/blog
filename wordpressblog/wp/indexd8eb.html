				<p>Started out for Kottayam at 8:30am. Approx 140km. Arrived 12pm at Backwater Ripples which was very pleasant. Customer service is much better as well. Very nice room with view across backwaters.<br />
Took a taxi to Coconut Lagoon for lunch but it was fully booked. Had lunch at The Taj instead- Chicken Biriani. Had coconut water to drink by straw straight out of the coconut.<br />
Cost was approx 2500 Rupees/approx ï¿½30. Very expensive meal!<br />
Headed back to Backwater Ripples.<br />
Sunbathed by pool.<br />
Had cup of coffee &amp; game of ping pong.<br />
Ordered a beer &amp; sat by lake to watch sun go down.<br />
Watched entertainment&#8230;.traditional dancing. Had dinner &amp; watched tv before bed.</p>

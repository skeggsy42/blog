			<h2>Tromso</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Setoff at 4:40am and arrived at London Stansted at 05:30. Parked at NCP short stay carpark and walked to terminal. Checkin not open so got coffees and croissant (ï¿½5.50). Plane due to depart at 8:25 and arrive at Oslo Gardermoen at 11:30. Flight was delayed by 1 hour. Spent 48 Kr on flight (Norwegan airlines) on twik and coffee.<br />
Oslo airport initial impression is large amounts of wood panelling. Train inside airport to Oslo Sentralstacion cost 172kr for single ticket for two. Left 12:38 and arrived about 45 minutes later.<br />
We had 2 burger king jr meals for 120Kr.<br />
Walked to National Gallery and viewed Munch&#8217;s Scream and other works including Madonna.<br />
Walked up to the royal palace and then to the harbour before heading back to the station. Paid 172kr for our single tickets back on the slow train to the airport. Unfortunately we got off the train at the wrong stop approx 16km short and then paid 320Kr for a taxi the rest of the way! Arrived at airport 5:30pm for flight at 19:05. Arrived Tromso 21:10. Had a haagen das vanilla ice cream for 21kr and then got the bus to the hotel thon polar. Bus took 20mins. Much colder here than Oslo! Probably minus 3 or 4 degrees centigrade at night. Lots of snow although not actually snowing.</p>

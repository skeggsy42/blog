				<p><a title="norman.jpg" href="wp-content/uploads/2008/05/norman.jpg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2008/05/norman.jpg" alt="norman.jpg" /></a>Deluxe sleeper cabin on our train to Berlin is as described and includes a shower and toilet and bunk beds. Wake up call at 07:00 includes coffee and breakfast (roll,croisant and juice). Sat back and enjoyed the scenery roll by. Saw some deer and also a springer spaniel chasing the train. Train arrives Berlin hbf about 08:20. Hbf is impressive. Paid €0.80 to use ultra clean toilet. Bought a day ticket for €6.20 then walked 1100m to Reichstag. Joined queue 09:30am. Got in finally at about 11:00am. Walked to top of dome (designed by Norman Foster). Walked to Brandonburg Gate. Had a currywurst, chips and coffee from a roadside hut for €5.40. Walked/metro&#8217;d to Checkpoint Charlie. Then metro&#8217;d to Oranien-burger Tor and trekked to Kuchi where I had a strawberry calpico, red snapper and sushi. Total bill inc tip €30.<br />
Took train to warschaemer st to see East Side Gallery, the remaining 1.3km section of the Berlin wall that is now covered in graffiti art.<br />
Took metro/trains to hbf to pick up luggage and then to Savignyplatz and walked to our hotel (Imperial Hotel) to check in.<br />
Took train to Hackescher Markt for food in evening. Went in Rocco. Nice location and meal was cheap at €24 for two mains and two drinks but won&#8217;t win any medals for the food or service. Back along Savignyplatz had a hot chocolate with cream and apfelstrudel with custard, Yamini had coffee and ice cream. This came to €10.50. Could live down this street!</p>

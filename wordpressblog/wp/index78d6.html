				<p>Problem with water in our hotel enkurs which was not clever. Not so much as an apology or provision of bottled water. Could not eat the breakfast. Checked out about 9:00am. Bused and walked to station to leave luggage and then walked to old town. Went up lift of St. Peters Basilica (800 yrs old) to top of spire, 130meters. Great view of city from here. We were able to do all our sightseeing from here. Got 12:30 eurolines luxury bus to Tallin arrival eta 17:00 and cost 26Lat for two. Eurolines had wifi and free coffee and was very comfortable. Jumped on a tram number 4 to our Hotel, Reval Central. Nice hotel, nice clean (slightly quirky design) room, nice shower. After freshening up left hotel at 18:00 for the old town, about 10 minute walk. Went to Old Hansa, a medieval restaurant with authentic medieval food (which I think is probably well researched) and girls playing medieval music. Place was oversubscribed and we did not have a booking but they gave us a table for 1 hour. Waiters all dressed in medieval clothes and our waiter put on a very good act. Dad could get a job here. I had arabian beef in fig sauce with lentils and Yamini had himalyan lamb with spices. Both had honeyed dark beer. Bill was 496 EEK (Â£25). Then went for a walk around the old town, the city wall is impressive. Found the Depeche Mode bar, did not got in but took a picture. Went for irish coffee in Reval Cafe near old square. Had a pint in Kehrwieder on main square, a cafe bar in a cellar.</p>

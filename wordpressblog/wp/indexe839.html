Breakfast at 9:30 today. Walked up to storgata past the mack brewery (the most northern brewery in the world!)<br />
and then polaria neither of which were open. Had a coffee in the Shell garage - free even if you dont buy anything. Walked to Polar Mueseum which was open.<br />
Had lunch at the Meiereit near our hotel. Food was not bad and cheap. Had an hours snooze in hotel room and then got our coach at 16:00 to Skorjov which arrived at about 19:40. Transferred to our coastal steamer Ms Midnatsol (Midnight Sun), a big cruise ship with 1000 capacity although at this time probably only 20 people on board. Destination is Tromso at midnight. Consumed a number of beers at 53kr each (these are european measures so about 1/2 pint), a salmon lok(49kr) and piece of cake (33kr).<br />
Spent much time on the subzero sundeck hopeful of seeing northern lights despite the extreme weather (incredible winds and severe snow). Resulted in doing a shift system, 10 mins in and 10 mins out to beat the cold.</p>

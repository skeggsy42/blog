				<p>Taxi from hotel at 7:20am to Chennai Airport, arrived 7:40am. Plane to Bombay departs at 9:15am.<br />
Arrived 11:00am<br />
Met Auntie Raji &amp; Avinash at airport.<br />
Taxi from airport to Taj President hotel took 1.5 hours. Whilst in taxi targeted by child beggars. Very good sea view from our 15th floor room.  Went for a walk at 14:30 towards Colaba. Had lunch at Shiv Sagar vegetarian restaurant.<br />
Saw The Gateway To India &amp; enquired about ferry tickets to Elephanta Island.  Then walked towards Regal Cinema.  Yamini casually held onto a yellow rail, only to find her hands were covered in wet paint.  (It was several hours before the paint had completely disappeared). Dropped into Central Cottage Industries Emporium on Shivaji Marg. Fantastic table &amp; chairs for approx ï¿½4000. They offer export services but decided to leave it this time. Took cab to Churchgate district in search of a bookshop. Cab was 50 rupees inc tip.<br />
After finding bookshop took cab back to hotel, also 50 rupees. Had coke &amp; beer &amp; retired to room.<br />

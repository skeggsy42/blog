			<h2>Wednesday 30th April</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Up about 7:00am. Stopped at supermarkt for breakfast on way to station and to buy supplies for our long train trip to Krakow. Train departs at 09:40 from Berlin Hbf. Border crossing to Poland approx 11:45am. Border police very through and walked off with our passports for 5 worrying minutes, not sure if they were going to jump off train and run off with them. The problem was that they did not know of Lewisham, but they were happy when explained that Lewisham is in London. Landscape for first half of journey is forest, farmland and small settlements. More opportunities to see live venison in the wild.<br />
Train passes through Wroclaw at 15:30.<br />
Train passes through Katowice at 18:14. Arrived Krakow 19:44. Caught a taxi to hotel on miodawa, 1.7km 18 zl. Walked to main square and had dinner in Wierzynek. Bill was 465 zl (Â£106). I had smoked assorted fish (salmon, eel and sturgeon) followed by venison seasoned with juniper. Finished off with tokai 1995 puttynos 5. Yam had herring followed by beef and then a Polish coffee (with Krupnik). Had a walk round square and then walked back to apartment (1 km).<br />
Got back about 12:30.</p>

				<p>Driven to Thekarry, approx 115 km away.Started out at 8am. Lovely scenery along the way but roads absolutely terrible so v.slow going. Arrived 11:30am at Saj Jungle Village where we were staying.<br />
Had elephant ride at 2pm. Unfortunately we went for the overpriced unofficial version. Went for boat ride within the sanctuary. We saw Sambar deer, black monkeys, rather cute otters, water snake, tortoise, wild boar &amp; a kingfisher. Then dropped back at bottom of our road &amp; walked back up stopping at The Taj hotel for drinks &amp; snacks (Samosas &amp; french fries). Saw lots of large bats against clear night sky, probably the most impressive sight today.<br />
Incredibly exhausted so had fairly early one.<br />
Not overly impressed with the man on reception at Jungle Village.<br />

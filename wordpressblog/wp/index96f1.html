				<p><a href='wp-content/uploads/2008/02/20061205-dsc02240.JPG' title='Nelson Mandela's cell'><img src='wp-content/uploads/2008/02/20061205-dsc02240.JPG' alt='20061205-dsc02240.JPG' /></a></p>
<p>Drove to waterfront and parked up for 10am appointment for the Robben Island tour. Catamarran to the island took 1hour.<br />
Saw seals in the harbour. Also saw penguins floating in the sea on the way. On arrival to the island we transferred to a tour bus for a 40 minute tour of the island. The driver was very informative and also very entertaining. Saw bontibock and an oyster catcher.<br />
We then transferred to our guide on foot, he was called Spark and was an inmate for 7 years. We viewed the cell where Nelson Mandela was kept and also Spark&#8217;s cell room which would have housed 80 prisoners. Nelson&#8217;s cell was pretty small and he was not allowed to talk to anyone in all the years that he was there.<br />
Got back to the waterfront at approx 14:20. Stopped for another cinnamon pancake with icecream and coffee with cream on the waterfront.<br />
Drove to the District Six museum. Arrived approx 3:15pm, stayed about 30 mins.<br />
Stopped at market at Capetown railway station, purchased a pair of shoes for 130R. Yam bought two pairs of shoes for 100R and 130R and also a bag for 50R. Then drove to waterfront and walked around craft market, thought it a little too expensive. Walked around the mall and surrounding shops and purchased some gifts.<br />
Went back to the hotel to get ready for our meal at the revolving restaurant at the top of the Ritz. Meal was at about 8:50, finished about 11pm.<br />
Service was slow, maybe because we had a late table. Food was pretty good though not outstanding. The restaurant completes a revolution in 60 minutes, we went round twice. I had crocodile and springbok carpaccio for starter, yamini had beetroot carpaccio. I had gemsbok for main, Yamini had beef steak. I passed on dessert but had a dessert wine while Yamini had creme caramel.<br />
Also had a bottle of riesling (82R) but it was not that good.</p>

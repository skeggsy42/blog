			<h2>Thursday 1st May</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Up early 6:30. Made a german friend, Laura who showed us the way to the bus station on foot through the planty park. At 08:15 bought a bus ticket to Auschwitz (18zl single for two) for 09:30am, first available. Had a coffee in train station. Paid to go in toilet at train station but did not go as toilets were disgusting. Whats more you have to pay more for a number one but there was no toilet paper. At 09:00 we found our coach which was ram packed already&#8230;no seat..did not fancy standing for 2 hours so sacked that. Now missed 09:15 train so booked train ticket for tomorrow morning (19zl single for two people). Booked tickets for walking tour of Krakow for 1:45pm today. Stopped for amaretto coffee and apple pie in main square. Walked back to apartment for a short rest. Headed off to our walking tour which was very interesting and went on till about 5pm. Walked back to apartment. Figured out that our bus tickets actually had seat reservations! Decided to check out early tomorrow and go straight to Zakopane from Auschwitz so settled up apartment bill with Martine and Magda (Honey Apartment, Miodowa St, 21 - www.honeyapartments.eu) tonight. Stopped for a coffee with them. They are both very nice and have been very helpful and informative. Went out to restaurant opposite Wawel hill which serves traditional polish food. I had pork knuckle, roast potatoes, shredded beetroot and cabbage which was very nice. Yam had lamb sausage and fries. I had a couple of beers (Paulener Munich). Bill came to 63 zl (approx Â£14) which was incredibly reasonable.</p>

			<h2>Sunday 1st January 2006</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Driven from Cochin to Munnar staying at KTDC Tea County. (Started snacking on the banana chips Babitha bought for us.  Very moorish).  Saw another elephant being riden down road along the way.<br />
Munnar is very mountainous &amp; tropically lush!<br />
Went for a stroll to the shops in Munnar. Had my photo taken by someone with their mobile phone camera. Took an auto-ricksaw to tourist information &amp; booked a tour for tomorrow. Autoricksaw man waited for us &amp; took us on a mini tour. He showed us a coffee tree &amp; we picked some coffee pods. Also saw some Cardomon plants and tea plantations. Cost of autoricksaw was 100 + 20 tip.<br />
Took a stroll around market &amp; bought some bananas for 13.5 rupees. Bananas not that nice, peachy colour inside &amp; quite tough.  Perhaps these are meant for cooking.<br />
Back at Tea County.  Had a game of snooker before dinner.</p>

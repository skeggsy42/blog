				<p>Hung around flat most of the day.<br />
Had egg curry for lunch &amp; went for a bit of a walk.  Yamini&#8217;s cousin Krishnan, wife Sree Devi and daughter Smrithi visited and brought us presents.  Raman, also came round, with a small oil burner.<br />
Left flat at 3:30pm for Ernakulum train station. Train station very busy. Had someone carry our luggage on their head to our train.<br />
Mistaken for a famous Croatian tennis player whilst standing on the platform.<br />
Witnessed a proper scrum to get on the train, pushing &amp; shoving is acceptable. Thankfully we are A/C sleeper class with allocated seat/beds. Sleep disrupted by loud snoring.  Train supposed to depart for Madras/Chennai at 17:10. Actually departed at 17:50. Still about 12 hours to make up the time.<br />
Continued reading Brave New World.<br />
Indian coffee is very nice-I think because it has the texture of hot chocolate.<br />
Palghat Junction 21:49pm.<br />
Erode Junction 12:42am<br />
Arkkonam Junction 6:30am<br />
Arrival in Chennai approx 8:00am.<br />
Total of 15 hours, 3 hours late.</p>

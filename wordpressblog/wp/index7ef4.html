				<p>Had planned to go back to Boulders beach but it was a rainy day so decided not to get up early after all.<br />
Instead we drove and parked near Edgars department store on Aderley Street. I purchased 3 pairs of shoes for 1200R.<br />
We then drove to Klein Constantia to taste their sauvignon blanc which was lovely, the semillion (not so good) and the Vin de Constance 2001 (must be the best dessert wine I&#8217;ve had to date). We bought a bottle of sauvignon blanc and 3 bottles of the vin de constance which all came to about 800R. Had some trouble getting all this stuff in our suitcases and contemplated purchasing another suitcase. Drove to Buitenverwachting winery for some lunch. While waiting for the restaurant to open we emptied our suitcases and repacked from scratch and successfully managed to pack everything!<br />
The restaurant was very pleasant. Served with a complementary grilled line fish of the day (yellow tail, which was quite meaty and flavoursome). Also served a selection of breads and spreads which were very nice. I chose a trio of ostrich for main course, yamini went for chicken confit. Food was excellent, service excellent. Also a lovely view of the vineyard.<br />
Drove to Groot Constantia (winery) for a quick look in their shop, did not stay long. Then drove to Kirstenbosch and spent some time in the shop and gardens before setting off for the airport. Arrived at the airport and dropped car off at approx 5pm. Checked in, no queues! After shrink wrapping our luggage for 25R per suitcase I claimed back 130R for tax on shoe purchases. Had a couple of hours to check out the shops. Plane boarded 20:30 for 20:40 flight.<br />
Watched Pirates of the caribbean, dead mans chest. Flight arrived approx 6:30 following morning.</p>

			<h2>Kitchen</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Had moben designer in for a quote (http://www.moben.co.uk). He measured up and drew a scale plan of our kitchen. He had some good ideas on the layout of our kitchen which we hadn&#8217;t thought of. He even left a copy of the plan. Only concern is the price included a 20% discount which you only get if you take their finance agreement. You can pay the finance company within the first month without incurring any interest charges but this is effectively paying up front before the work is done. Otherwise we really like the red kitchen!<br />
Also visited porcelanosa to get prices for floor tiles.<br />
Considering other options, like idea of importing our own kitchen from Germany!<br />
Dropped into Porcelanosa who supply tiles. They won&#8217;t lay floor tiles but suggested Profile Tiling, profile-tiling@blueyonder.co.uk. Apparently they charge approx �25/sq metre.<br />
The tiles we decided on are black and white:<br />
Nova (white) C223102001 �35.37 per square metre inc vat 31.60 x 31.60cm<br />
Turin Antracenta P11122091 �35.37 per square metre inc vat 31.60 x 31.60cm<br />
6 sq metres would cost �212 for the tiles and �150 fitting.<br />
Homebase Art Deco black and white �7.99 for 1m2=�47.94 for 6m2.</p>
<p>Plan of action:<br />
Move hot water plumbing so can knock down larder. Done.<br />
Box in pipes.</p>
<p>Pull up floorboards and replace with 18mm exterior grade plywood. Will need to move ikea cooker unit to complete.<br />
Require 9.5m2 exterior grade plywood minimum 18mm estimate �123.37<br />
Current floorboard thickness is 20mm.<br />
Tile thickness 8mm</p>
<p>Plywood sizes:<br />
1220 x 607 (4 x 2 ft) x 18mm = �9.49 wickes<br />
1827 x 607 (6 x 2 ft(<br />
2440 x 1220 (8 x 4 ft)<br />
Gap between rafters is 33cm/13in.<br />
Strengthen rafters so they can take additional weight of floor tiles. Propose to use bricks placed under rafters.<br />
How many bricks required? Do any rafters need replacing?</p>
<p>Earthbonding<br />
Move dishwasher next to back door.<br />
Knock down larder. Brick up vent.<br />
Remove lead pipes from walls.<br />
Remove old tiles around window.<br />
Get plasterer in.<br />
Paint walls red.</p>

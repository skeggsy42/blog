   <h2>Look-through earnings</h2>
   <p>Investors can benefit by focussing on their own look-through earnings. To calculate these, they should determine the underlying earnings attributable to the shares they hold in their portfolio and total these. The goal of each investor should be to create a porfolio (in effect, a “company”) that will deliver him or her the highest possible look-through earnings a decade or so from now.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-white">
    <h2>Working Capital Requirements</h2>
     
    <p> The working capital of a firm is the difference between its current assets and its current liabilities. 
     Since funds tied up in working capital cannot be used elsewhere in the firm, changes in working capital affect the 
     cashflows of the firm – increases in working capital are cash outflows and decreases in working capital are cash inflows.</p>

     <p>In the context of valuation, the working capital needs of the firm have to be taken into consideration in 
      calculating the cashflows to equity.</p>

     <p>The accounting definition of working capital includes cash in current assets. 
      This is appropriate as long as the cash is necessary for the day to day operation of the firm. 
      Any cash beyond this requirement should not be considered in calculating working capital for the purposes of 
      cashflow calculation, since an accumulation of cash above that necessary for day to day operations is not a cash outflow. 
      This is particularly relevant when valuing companies such as Apple with excess cash on the balance sheet.</p>

     <p>The working capital needs of a firm will in large part be determined by the type of business it is in. 
      Retail firms have a much higher need for working capital, as a percentage of revenues, since they have higher 
      inventory and credit needs than do service firms (though note that Walmart has negative working capital as it 
      takes a long time to pay its suppliers).</p>

     <p>Furthermore, the changes in working capital will be correlated to the growth rate of the firm. 
      In general, higher growth firms can expect to have much larger increases in working capital than lower-growth 
      firms in the same line of business.</p>

     <p>Growing businesses have working capital needs that increase relative to sales growth and significant requirements 
      for fixed asset investments. A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to 
      be a satisfactory investment but it is far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no 
      major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft or Google. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, 
      requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money (think airlines).</p>

     <p>The failure to consider working capital needs in valuation will result in the over estimation of cashflows 
      to equity and the value of equity in the firm.</p>

     <p>A decrease in working capital requirements in any one year might result in increased free cash flows even 
      though net income might be lower.</p>

   <h2>Return on Equity and Debt-to-equity ratios</h2>
   <p>Return on Equity (ROE) is extremely important for assessing the effectiveness of managements ability to 
    reinvest profits in the business.</p>
   <pre>ROE = Net income/book value of equity</pre>
   <p>The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity 
    capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry etc) and not the achievement of consistent 
    gains in earnings per share.</p>

  <p>ROE captures all aspects of how shareholders money is employed. It does not matter whether the money has 
   been used on new equipment or the company paid too much for acquiring a competitor. 
   The net income must follow the investment level to maintain steady ROE.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a company that takes on good projects should have a ROE that exceeds its cost of equity. 
   Since increasing leverage also increases the cost of equity, the ROE will have to increase by more than the 
   cost of equity for higher leverage to be in the best interest of the company.</p>

   <p>Increasing leverage will lead to a higher ROE if the pre-interest, after-tax return on projects (assets) 
    exceeds the after-tax interest rate paid on debt.</p>

   <p>Look for steady/increasing trend of ROE of 8% over a period of ten years but note that it differs per industry.</p>

   <p>A major driver behind the validity of ROE is the company’s financing structure. 
   A company can be financed with equity or debt or a combination of the two. 
   Be cautious about companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of higher than 0.5.</p>

   <p>A company that borrows money to finance projects and earns a ROA on those projects that exceeds the after-tax 
   interest rate it pays on its debt will be able to increase its ROE by borrowing.</p>

   <p>High D/E may equal a ROE mirage. Increasing leverage will lead to a higher ROE. 
   ROE of 10% with zero debt (D/E=0%) is equivalent to ROE of 20% with 50% debt (D/E=1.00).</p>

   <p>As ROE includes debt in the equation you can adjust for debt to compare companies with debt to companies without debt.</p>
   <pre> ROE = (earnings+interest expense on debt)/(equity+debt) *100.</pre>
   <p>Is this not the same as the return on assets calculation?!</p>

   <p>ROE might also be skewed if the company holds excess assets such as cash earning a low interest rate. 
    So adjust for excess cash: 
   </p>  
   <pre> ROE=(earnings-interest income)/(equity-cash)</pre>
   <pre class="literal-block"> Debt-to-equity ratio = (Interest bearing Long term debt+notes payable) / equity.
   </pre>
   <p>Choose companies with a D/E of below 0.5 and you will most likely end up with companies with lower ROE, 
    but they will likely be more sustainable in the future.</p>

    <p>You should look at the value and trend of ROE with one eye, and the financing structure (D/E) with the other.</p>

    <p>If the company had no debt, the Return on Assets (ROA) and ROE would be the exact same number. 
    If you are buying a company with a lot of debt, you will probably want to use the ROA instead of the ROE.</p>

    <p><pre class="literal-block">
    ROA = net income/Total Assets. (Total assets = all assets from goodwill to inventory).</pre></p>

    <p>ROA will always be lower than ROE if the company has debt. This is because Assets = equity + liabilities.</p>

    <p>ROE and ROA calculations are distorted by ignoring differences between reported equity & assets and between tangible 
     equity & assets in addition to distortions due to differing tax rates and debt levels.</p>

    <p>Focus on whether ROA is higher than competitors rather than above a specific amount but generally ROA should be over 6%.</p>

    <h2>Intrinsic value</h2>
    <p>Intrinsic value can be defined simply: it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of the business during its remaining life.</p>
 </div>
<div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-white">
    <h2>Economic Goodwill and High Return on Net Tangible Assets</h2>
    <p>High return on net tangible assets indicates the existence of economic goodwill far larger than the total original cost of our accounting goodwill (Essays of Warren Buffet 4th ed loc 4800)</p>

    <p>Protection against inflation. A doubling of inflation would mean a doubling in the companies nominal investment in net tangible assets. A doubling of dollar sales means correspondingly more dollars must be employed immediately in receivables and inventories.</p>

    <p>During inflation, goodwill is the gift that keeps giving. But that statement applies, naturally, only to the economic goodwill. Spurious accounting goodwill is another matter. When an over-excited management purchases a business for a silly price, the same accounting niceties are observed. Because it can’t go anywhere else, the silliness ends up in the goodwill account. The 40 year ritual is observed and the adrenalin so capitalised remains on the books as an “asset” just as if the acquisition had been a sensible one.</p>

    <p>What a business can be expected to earn on unleveraged net tangible assets, excluding any charges against earnings for amortisation of goodwill is the best guide to the economic attractiveness of the operation. It is also the best guide to the current value of the operations economic goodwill.</p>

    <p><pre>Return on unleveraged net tangible assets = (net income + amortisation charges) / (total assets – goodwill – intangible assets)</pre></p>

    <p>Managements usually detest purchase accounting because it almost always requires that a “goodwill” account be established and subsequently written off – a process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge that normally persists for decades. In contrast, pooling avoids a goodwill account, which is why managements love it.</p>

    <p>“Eventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens – most often at the 15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlying economics of Berkshire’s business.” Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report 2016 pg 15.</p>

 <h2>Evaluating companies with debt</h2>
<p>If cash substantially exceeds notes payable then debt can ordinarily be dismissed. If debt is larger than cash then it is clear the company is relying heavily on the banks.</p>
<p>Study the debt over a period of years to see whether it is growing faster than sales and profits. If they are this is a definite sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Evaluate the default risk by looking at interest coverage ratio which examines the capacity of the company to meet interest payments (but doesn’t measure the ability to pay back the outstanding debt)</p>
 <pre><p>interest coverage ratio = earnings before interest & taxes / interest expenses</pre></p>
<p>The denominator in the interest coverage ratio can easily be extended to cover other fixed obligations such as lease payments. If this is done, the ratio is called a fixed charges coverage ratio:</p>
<pre><p>fixed charges coverage ratio =  Earnings before interest, fixed charges & taxes/ fixed charges</pre></p>
<p>Both interest and fixed charges coverage ratios are open to the criticism that they do not consider capital expenditures, cashflows that may be discretionary in the very short term but not in the long term, if the company wants to maintain growth. One way of capturing the extent of this cashflow, relative to operating cashflows, is to compute the ratio of the two:
<pre><p>operating cashflow/capex ratio = cashflows from operations/capital expenditures</p></pre>
<p>While there are a number of different definitions of cashflows from operations, the most reasonable way of defining it is to measure the cashflows from continuing operations, before interest but after taxes and after meeting working capital needs.</p>
<pre><p>cashflows from operations= EBIT(1-taxrate)-Change in working capital</p></pre>
<p>You can evaluate the company’s capacity to pay back the principal on outstanding debt using the debt ratios:</p>
<pre><p>debt/capital ratio = debt/(debt+equity)</pre></p>
<p><pre>debt/equity ratio = debt/equity</pre></p>
<p>The first ratio measures debt as a proportion of the total capital of the firm and cannot exceed 100%. The second measures debt as proportion of the book value of equity in the firm</p>
<p>What to include in debt:</p>
<p>a) hybrid securities = part debt, part equity, like convertible bonds and preferred stocks. Estimate the debt and equity components separately for hybrid securities and add these components to their respective sides.</p>
<p>b) off-balance sheet commitments such as contingent liabilities. General rule is to ignore contingent liabilities that hedge against risk since the obligations on the contingent claim will be offset by benefits elsewhere.</p>
<p>c) leases. capitalized leases are now shown as part of debt, but operating leases are not. Since a fine line separates the two, the conservative approach to estimating debt ratios will capitalize operating leases and show them as part of debt.</p>
<p>d) Pensions. Firms generally include in their debt the excess of accumulated benefit obligation over the pension fund assets. Here again, a conservative estimate of the debt ratio will consider projected benefit obligation over pension fund assets.</p>
<p>e) Debt of non-consolidated entities. Firms generally do not have to show as a liability that debt that is owed by their nonconsolidated subsidiaries, even though they may have guaranteed and stand liable for that borrowing. The conservative approach will add this debt to the firms total debt and compute the debt ratio on that basis.</p>

<div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-white">
   <h2>Growth</h2>
   <p>When estimating growth focus on revenue growth and look at growth each year (don’t average).</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-white">
<h2>Ratios</h2>
<p>Debt-equity ratio. If it exceeds 0.5 understand how the company got there. If the company's debt is increasing try to understand why.</p>
<p>Current ratio=current assets/current liabilities. Threshold is that it should be over 1,0, or 1.5 to be safe. It's expected that money going out will not be higher than money coming in. (or the company will be forced to take on debt). There is a trade-off between minimizing liquidity risk and tying up more and more cash in working capital (w/c = current assets minus current liabilities)</p>
<p>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of revenue/Inventory. Shows the speed at which a company turns inventory into sales. Capital in inventory is expensive. Research industry standard but take inventory turnover of 4 as a rule of thumb for products with a high duration.</p>
 <p><pre>Accounts Receivable Turnover = turnover/accounts receivable.</pre> To make this more meaningful convert it into days by dividing 365 by the turnover ratio. This is a nice key ratio to keep an eye on if the company sells a lot on credit. How quickly does the company get it's money? In other words how quickly does the company turn accounts receivable into cash?</p>
 <p><pre>Accounts Payable Turnover = Cost of Revenue/Accounts Payable.</pre> Convert to days by dividing 365 by the turnover ratio. Shows how long the company takes to repay suppliers. A high accounts payable turnover ratio means the company pays back suppliers quickly, therefore no problem honouring debt obligations.</p>
 <p><pre>Free cash flow = operating cash flow + property, plant and equipment, net.</pre> Property, plant & equip is sometimes referred to as capital expenditures/CAPEX and we assume spent to maintain and develop the business. Look to invest in businesses with high and stable free cash flow.</p>
<p><pre>Investing-cash-flow-to-operating-cash-flow-ratio = investing cash flow/operating cash flow.</pre> eg 1653/3098 = 53.3% means that for every $100 in cash from operations, $53.3 in cash are spent on maintaining and investing in the company's growth. The question is, are these cash investments for growing the business or cash outlays for maintaining the existing business?</p>

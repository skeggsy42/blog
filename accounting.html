    <h2>Working Capital Requirements</h2>
     
    <p> The working capital of a firm is the difference between its current assets and its current liabilities. 
     Since funds tied up in working capital cannot be used elsewhere in the firm, changes in working capital affect the 
     cashflows of the firm – increases in working capital are cash outflows and decreases in working capital are cash inflows.</p>

     <p>In the context of valuation, the working capital needs of the firm have to be taken into consideration in 
      calculating the cashflows to equity.</p>

     <p>The accounting definition of working capital includes cash in current assets. 
      This is appropriate as long as the cash is necessary for the day to day operation of the firm. 
      Any cash beyond this requirement should not be considered in calculating working capital for the purposes of 
      cashflow calculation, since an accumulation of cash above that necessary for day to day operations is not a cash outflow. 
      This is particularly relevant when valuing companies such as Apple with excess cash on the balance sheet.</p>

     <p>The working capital needs of a firm will in large part be determined by the type of business it is in. 
      Retail firms have a much higher need for working capital, as a percentage of revenues, since they have higher 
      inventory and credit needs than do service firms (though note that Walmart has negative working capital as it 
      takes a long time to pay its suppliers).</p>

     <p>Furthermore, the changes in working capital will be correlated to the growth rate of the firm. 
      In general, higher growth firms can expect to have much larger increases in working capital than lower-growth 
      firms in the same line of business.</p>

     <p>Growing businesses have working capital needs that increase relative to sales growth and significant requirements 
      for fixed asset investments. A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to 
      be a satisfactory investment but it is far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no 
      major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft or Google. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, 
      requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money (think airlines).</p>

     <p>The failure to consider working capital needs in valuation will result in the over estimation of cashflows 
      to equity and the value of equity in the firm.</p>

     <p>A decrease in working capital requirements in any one year might result in increased free cash flows even 
      though net income might be lower.</p>

   <h2>Return on Equity and Debt-to-equity ratios</h2>
   <br>
   <p>Return on Equity (ROE) is extremely important for assessing the effectiveness of managements ability to 
    reinvest profits in the business.<br>

    <code>ROE = Net income/book value of equity</code>
   </p>
   <p>The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity 
    capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry etc) and not the achievement of consistent 
    gains in earnings per share.</p>

  <p>ROE captures all aspects of how shareholders money is employed. It does not matter whether the money has 
   been used on new equipment or the company paid too much for acquiring a competitor. 
   The net income must follow the investment level to maintain steady ROE.</p>

 <p>Generally speaking, a company that takes on good projects should have a ROE that exceeds its cost of equity. 
  Since increasing leverage also increases the cost of equity, the ROE will have to increase by more than the 
  cost of equity for higher leverage to be in the best interest of the company.</p>

<p>Increasing leverage will lead to a higher ROE if the pre-interest, after-tax return on projects (assets) 
 exceeds the after-tax interest rate paid on debt.</p>

<p>Look for steady/increasing trend of ROE of 8% over a period of ten years but note that it differs per industry.</p>

<p>A major driver behind the validity of ROE is the company’s financing structure. 
 A company can be financed with equity or debt or a combination of the two. 
 Be cautious about companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of higher than 0.5.</p>

<p>A company that borrows money to finance projects and earns a ROA on those projects that exceeds the after-tax 
 interest rate it pays on its debt will be able to increase its ROE by borrowing.</p>

<p>High D/E may equal a ROE mirage. Increasing leverage will lead to a higher ROE. 
 ROE of 10% with zero debt (D/E=0%) is equivalent to ROE of 20% with 50% debt (D/E=1.00).</p>

<p>As ROE includes debt in the equation you can adjust for debt to compare companies with debt to companies without debt. 
 <br>
 <pre class="code">
 ROE = (earnings+interest expense on debt)/(equity+debt) *100. 
 </pre>
 Is this not the same as the return on assets calculation?!</p>

<p>ROE might also be skewed if the company holds excess assets such as cash earning a low interest rate. 
 So adjust for excess cash: 
 <p>  
 <pre class="code">
 ROE=(earnings-interest income)/(equity-cash)
 </pre>
</p>
 

<p>
 <pre class="literal-block">
 Debt-to-equity ratio = (Interest bearing Long term debt+notes payable) / equity.
 </pre>
 </p>

<p>Choose companies with a D/E of below 0.5 and you will most likely end up with companies with lower ROE, 
 but they will likely be more sustainable in the future.</p>

<p>You should look at the value and trend of ROE with one eye, and the financing structure (D/E) with the other.</p>

<p>If the company had no debt, the Return on Assets (ROA) and ROE would be the exact same number. 
 If you are buying a company with a lot of debt, you will probably want to use the ROA instead of the ROE.</p>

 <p><pre class="literal-block">
 ROA = net income/Total Assets. (Total assets = all assets from goodwill to inventory).</pre></p>

<p>ROA will always be lower than ROE if the company has debt. This is because Assets = equity + liabilities.</p>

<p>ROE and ROA calculations are distorted by ignoring differences between reported equity & assets and between tangible 
 equity & assets in addition to distortions due to differing tax rates and debt levels.</p>

<p>Focus on whether ROA is higher than competitors rather than above a specific amount but generally ROA should be over 6%.</p>

   <h2>Growth</h2>
   <p>When estimating growth focus on revenue growth and look at growth each year (don’t average).</p>

 <h2>Look-through earnings</h2>
 <p>
  Investors can benefit by focussing on their own look-through earnings. To calculate these, they should determine the underlying earnings attributable to the shares they hold in their portfolio and total these. The goal of each investor should be to create a porfolio (in effect, a “company”) that will deliver him or her the highest possible look-through earnings a decade or so from now.

    <h2>Intrinsic value</h2>
    <p>Intrinsic value can be defined simply: it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of the business during its remaining life.</p>

    <h2>Economic Goodwill and High Return on Net Tangible Assets</h2>
    <p>High return on net tangible assets indicates the existence of economic goodwill far larger than the total original cost of our accounting goodwill (Essays of Warren Buffet 4th ed loc 4800)</p>

    <p>Protection against inflation. A doubling of inflation would mean a doubling in the companies nominal investment in net tangible assets. A doubling of dollar sales means correspondingly more dollars must be employed immediately in receivables and inventories.</p>

    <p>During inflation, goodwill is the gift that keeps giving. But that statement applies, naturally, only to the economic goodwill. Spurious accounting goodwill is another matter. When an over-excited management purchases a business for a silly price, the same accounting niceties are observed. Because it can’t go anywhere else, the silliness ends up in the goodwill account. The 40 year ritual is observed and the adrenalin so capitalised remains on the books as an “asset” just as if the acquisition had been a sensible one.</p>

    <p>What a business can be expected to earn on unleveraged net tangible assets, excluding any charges against earnings for amortisation of goodwill is the best guide to the economic attractiveness of the operation. It is also the best guide to the current value of the operations economic goodwill.</p>

    <p>Return on unleveraged net tangible assets = (net income + amortisation charges) / (total assets – goodwill – intangible assets)</p>

    <p>Managements usually detest purchase accounting because it almost always requires that a “goodwill” account be established and subsequently written off – a process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge that normally persists for decades. In contrast, pooling avoids a goodwill account, which is why managements love it.</p>

    <p>“Eventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens – most often at the 15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlying economics of Berkshire’s business.” Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report 2016 pg 15.</p>

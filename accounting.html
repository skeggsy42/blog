    <h2>Working Capital Requirements</h2>
    <p> 
The working capital of a firm is the difference between its current assets and its current liabilities. Since funds tied up in working capital cannot be used elsewhere in the firm, changes in working capital affect the cashflows of the firm â€“ increases in working capital are cash outflows and decreases in working capital are cash inflows.
In the context of valuation, the working capital needs of the firm have to be taken into consideration in calculating the cashflows to equity.
The accounting definition of working capital includes cash in current assets. This is appropriate as long as the cash is necessary for the day to day operation of the firm. Any cash beyond this requirement should not be considered in calculating working capital for the purposes of cashflow calculation, since an accumulation of cash above that necessary for day to day operations is not a cash outflow. This is particularly relevant when valuing companies such as Apple with excess cash on the balance sheet.
The working capital needs of a firm will in large part be determined by the type of business it is in. Retail firms have a much higher need for working capital, as a percentage of revenues, since they have higher inventory and credit needs than do service firms (though note that Walmart has negative working capital as it takes a long time to pay its suppliers).
Furthermore, the changes in working capital will be correlated to the growth rate of the firm. In general, higher growth firms can expect to have much larger increases in working capital than lower-growth firms in the same line of business.
Growing businesses have working capital needs that increase relative to sales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments. A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment but it is far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft or Google. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money (think airlines).
The failure to consider working capital needs in valuation will result in the over estimation of cashflows to equity and the value of equity in the firm.
A decrease in working capital requirements in any one year might result in increased free cash flows even though net income might be lower.
